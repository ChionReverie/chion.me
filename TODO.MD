Gallery
[ ] UX issue: Readers aren't clicking gallery thumbnails.
    - Maybe add an icon to show what happens when they are clicked
    - Ensure other thumbnails can be clicked too
[ ] Add alt text and labels to practically everything

[ ] I want to be able to add an image without editing the source code of the website.
    - In order to do that, I should store images and gallery-lists in a bucket.
