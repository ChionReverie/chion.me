## Trivia

- Andi hand-crafted most of her travel outfit, with the exception of her magicical dress with extradimensional pockets, which was a gift from Big Paw and Little Paw for her 18th birthday.
- Andi possesses a first-edition pre-censorship copy of the Dwarven Codex of Intimate Care, a rare tome detailing the antics and discoveries of a group of particularly-adventurous Dwarves who were trapped in a cavern together for a year. This version of the book is banned in some cities for the graphic depictions within, but Andi does not know this.
- Andi can and will fall asleep anywhere she deems comfy enough, especially if she has someone to cuddle with.
- Using the magnetic properties of the Star Shard in her mechanical hand, Andi can produce and store an electrical charge. She developed this ability to catch fish, but has since found that it is quite effective in a combat situation.
- Andi's current whip, the Moon-Shard Whip, was a gift from an interdimensional traveler named Gavin. The merchant insisted on giving the item to her for free, whereas Andi insisted on providing payment. Eventually, they agreed to exchange it for a single copper piece.

## History

A sea-elven child appeared on the doorstep of the Miller house at around 1 year of age. Before then, her origins are uncertain. The Orcish smith and Human chef, affectionately referred to as Big Paw and Little Paw, raised her as their beloved daughter: Andrea Miller, or 'Andi' for short.

### Childhood

Andi has always had a curiosity about how things worked. She would take things apart and put them back together, she watched others work and tried to do the same as them. While it would sometimes get Andi into trouble, the others in the village couldn't help but admire her persistence. Eventually, the local wizard Matthias took notice and offered her an apprenticeship. At age 13, Andi was scheduled to begin studying magic, the one skill Andi struggled to pick up on her own.

Unfortunately, this apprenticeship never came. Matthias disappeared without a trace before it even began.

### Self-Study

As Andi grew up, she immersed herself deeper into literature and technology. With her own money, she purchased foreign tomes about ancient Divini creations. As she studied this ancient culture's technology, she rapidly picked up knowledge which she applied to her own inventions. She built a rotary machining system for Big Paw, which borrowed power from the family windmill. She also designed a variety of mechanical irrigation tools for the village's farms, but was never able to convince anyone to let her build them.

Technology was not the only topic which Andi enjoyed. Whenever the traveling merchants would come to town, she always took care to find the latest adventure and romance novels from the big cities. While this tendency to bury her nose in a book made it difficult for Andi to connect with her peers, through these tales Andi developed a healthy appreciation for the wider world.

### The Storm

At the age of 15, a voidstorm struck Andi's village. The chaos of the storm made the windmill spin out of control. Rather than seeking shelter, Andi rushed to protect the mill, to disengage the millstone before it broke down and took damage. As Andi reached out to pull a lever, something caused a piece of machinery to shatter, shooting shrapnel into her right arm.

After the voidstorm calmed down, Andi was rushed to the medical home. Unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done to save Andi's hand. The bones were shattered, and it had to be amputated at the forearm.

### Andi, Undeterred

After the incident with the windmill, Andi designed prototype after prototype for her mechanical hand. Still, no version she made fully sasitfied her. She strived for a perfection which would not come.

Then, on Andi's 18th birthday, a package arrived. It was a puzzle box containing a mysterious gem and a riddle. Andi studied the odd magnetic properties of the gem. It sympathetically responded to her will. Andi used this gem to develop a complete version of her mechanical hand, one not limited by the previous designs' lack of magical power.

Finally, Andi could turn her attention to solving the riddle. "Where the Sea meets the Sky at its deepest depths, where the Stars shine even in the Morning light. This is where you will find your next piece."

She packed up her bags, bid farewell to the men who raised her, and made her way to Cearivan. Maybe then, she will find someone to help her solve this mystery.

## Relationships

### Vargu & Jaydenm Miler - Adoptive Fathers

Vargu is an Orcish smith originally from an outlander tribe, who once manufactured weapons of war. Nowadays, he just wants to live in peace, and crafts tools for the people of Melaney.

Jayden is a Human event-caterer, local to Melaney. He inherited the mill from his parents, and fell in love with Vargu at first sight. Now raising Andi, he encourages his daughter to follow her passions and love who she is.

### Elijah Fallon - Comrade

This half-orc bounty hunter has been a member of Andi's traveling party since the group was first hired by Cearivan. Despite Andi's talents, she is inexperienced in battle, and has quickly learned to rely on Elijah's judgement when danger arises.

### Azaroth, the Hollow Mind - Pact Maker

On the route from Cearivan to Alnoraca, the airship the party was on was stopped by this ancient green dragon. Demanding tribute of information worthy of his intellectual horde, Azaroth presented a grave threat. It was only when Andi offered the contents of her journal that Azaroth gave pause; The inventions within were such that Azaroth had never before seen. Azaroth then made an offer to Andi: She would provide more rare secrets to the dragon in the future, and Azaroth would provide information in turn. Like a fool, Andi agreed.

### Cassandra Kain - Romantic Interest

Amid the Battle of the Bards in a bar in Alnoraca, Andi offered a drink to this Kitsune woman. Through a combination of misunderstandings turning into brave advances, the two found themselves a night of private companionship in Andi's room. While their current relationship status is unclear, one thing is certain: Andi is quite smitten.
