Hello! My name is Ilyana Eversky. My friends call me Ily. I'm a dollmaker who specializes in crafting high-quality plush dolls for display and hugging purposes. Back when I got my markings, I thought I was going to be a great Sentinel, or even a Warden. But now I know my true calling. I'm here on Azeroth to give people comfort and put smiles on their faces, one plush at a time.

This world has seen a lot of war. And I understand the need to fight these battles with brawn. But I have my own battles to fight, because our world needs compassion and love too.

## At-a-Glance

<!-- An at-a-glance sensory description (not as prose) -->

**Noncombatant**  
Does not carry a weapon or any kind of armor. Ilyana is a civilian by firm choice, and refuses to fight.  

**Outfit**  
Wears loose robes and dresses over tighter shorts and undershirt, which has the effect of making her figure appear more modest.

**OOC Notes**   
When buying a plush from Ilyana, you don't have to pay actual game currency. I'm happy to roleplay the act of silver changing hands without being paid in-game =p 

If you would like art of a doll Ilyana makes, check out my (Chion's) [commission page](/commissions). But please don't feel obligated to get art if you don't want or cannot afford it.

**The Starlight Rose**

If you need a place to rest your weary legs, the Starlight Rose Inn in Darnassus is the place to go. Ilyana (or another member of staff) will serve tea and warm sake, and you can chat about our troubles while seeking shelter from the rain.

**Ashenvale, Third War.**  
Shortly before the Battle of the Fel Well and the Death of Cenarius.
{:.block-heading}

The orc was left to die after the day's battle, ensnared in vines without a weapon or equipment. Ilyana approached, clutching a stolen scimitar in trembling, untrained hands. She raised the blade to its throat. 

The orc spits words in its nonsensical, villainous tongue. Although it is at her mercy, it dares to taunt Ilyana.

Heavy footsteps echo from behind her, the steps of a great cat bearing a heavy rider. "Set the blade down, Ily," says the druid Aledron Skywing, in a resonating tone. "This isn't you." 

Ilyana glances back at Aledron. Her teeth gritted, her hands tight on the handle of this foreign weapon. The orc struggles against the vines. Ilyana's attention snaps back to the Orc. 

She speaks up, her voice shaking. "Alevar is going to die to that curse, and these *things* are to blame. This monster does not belong in Ashenvale. It does not deserve to live."

"He does not belong here," the Druid agrees. He dismounts the sabercat. "But I am asking you to let him go."

Her voice hoarse, Ilyana cries out, "How can you expect me to forgive this thing, after all it has done?" 

"You are no killer, Ily," the druid states, calm yet stern. "If you kill a helpless peon like this, you will not be able to forgive yourself."

Aledron places his massive hand on Ilyana's shoulder.

Ilyana pauses, tears streaming down her face. She stares down at the pathetic, terrified, unarmed Orc. "I hate you," she says, "But killing you will do nothing to save my friend." 

She drops the sword. It hits the ground below with a loud clang. She rubs her hands, sore from clutching it so tight. 

Aledron lifts Ilyana and places her onto the sabercat. "Alevar will be at peace, knowing your hands are not stained with blood," he says.

The druid Aledron Skywing waves his hands with primal magic. "Remember Ilyana Eversky as the woman who spared your life." With that, the vines slithered off the orc. The orc stood up, rubbing his arms where the vines had held him. And he turned around. And ran away.
