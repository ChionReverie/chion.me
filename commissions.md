## Critter Sketch

This is the style I developed to draw plushies for my WoW character, Ilyana Eversky. 

**Price**: $12 USD

**Addons**:
* +50% per color variant
* If a sketch involves multiple critters, each critter is priced separately

## Chibi Emojis

Cute emojis for your discord server!

**Price**: $12 USD for 1 emoji, or $30 USD for 3

**Note**: For Emoji characters, you *must* provide a visual reference. Even just a screenshot of a character model in an MMO is enough.

## How to Order
To order from me, please contact me via my email form or via Discord (@chionreverie) if we share a mutual server or friends.

[Message Me!](/contact){:.call-to-action.btn}

In your message, provide details of the commission, including:
  * The type of piece you want made
  * A textual description of what you want drawn, including: Species, pose, colors, and what the art means/represents to you.
  * Any visual references you wish to provide.

## Process

I will provide a draft sketch after we have discussed the terms of the commission. Payment will be made once a draft sketch is agreed upon.

After the payment is made, I will begin working on the art. Feel free to request an estimate of when the art piece will be ready. 

Once the art is finished, will send you a full-resolution version.

## Payment

I accept payment over [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/U7U81HPC7S). You should only send payment *after* we have fully negotiated the price and details of the order.

<script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support me on Ko-fi', 'var(--sidebar-link-color-active)', 'U7U81HPC7S');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 

Tips are appreciated!

## Policies
1. I reserve the right to to terminate the commission and refund payment for any reason. 
2. I may reject a request for any reason, including if I am uncomfortable with the client or request, or if I feel I am not skilled enough to deliver a satisfactory product.
3. After work is completed, I may retain a copy to display on my website. If you do not want that, please let me know during price negotiations, not after. 
4. Only pay me if we have already agreed on what I'm making you. 
5. The art I draw is for personal (not commercial) use. Feel free to give the art as a gift, but I ask that you do not sell it.
